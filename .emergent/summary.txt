The previous AI engineer successfully developed a Network Checkpoint Monitor application, starting from a basic framework to a feature-rich MVP. Key milestones included configuring the frontend to run on port 3200 for external access, implementing a status monitoring dashboard utilizing existing backend APIs, and resolving preview URL routing complexities by adopting a dual-port strategy. A robust user authentication system was integrated, incorporating Google OAuth, age and email verification, and password reset functionalities with  and . The final significant addition was a NAS vault system for user profile data, leveraging MinIO object storage. This necessitated a comprehensive transition to a Docker Compose setup, orchestrating all services‚ÄîMinIO, MongoDB, FastAPI, React, and Nginx‚Äîfor streamlined deployment onto the user's Ugreen NAS. The engineer provided all essential Dockerfiles, compose configurations, and detailed setup guides, culminating in a production-ready application.

The user initiated the session by asking where they left off, mentioning port 3200 for ISP access. The initial requirement was to get the network checkpoint monitoring application running on port 3200 for both internal and external access. Subsequently, the user requested to test upload now, which translated into building a status monitoring dashboard capable of uploading and displaying network status checks. The project then expanded to include a comprehensive user authentication system, encompassing user registration, login, and user-specific data storage. This was further refined to incorporate email verification, age verification (18+), and password reset functionality, with an explicit request to use social OAuth (Google, Facebook, X) for identity and age validation. Finally, the user requested to create a vault system on their Ugreen DXP4800 Plus NAS for storing user profile data, such as pictures. This led to the development of a complete Docker Compose solution for the entire application stack, ready for deployment on the user's NAS.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration (MinIO, MongoDB, FastAPI, React, Nginx).
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt (password hashing), Google OAuth (social login, age/email verification).
-   **Object Storage:** MinIO (S3-compatible storage on NAS).
-   **Web Server/Proxy:** Nginx (reverse proxy for frontend/backend routing).

<current_work>
The most recent work involved finalizing the complete Docker Compose setup for the Network Checkpoint Monitor, specifically tailored for deployment on the user's Ugreen NAS. This entailed creating:
1.  A  file for local development and a  for production deployment using GHCR images.
2.  s for both the FastAPI backend () and the React frontend (), including Nginx configuration () for the frontend.
3.  An  file for easy configuration of NAS IP, database, MinIO, and JWT secrets.
4.  A  script to automate the entire system's startup, shutdown, and health checks.
5.  Comprehensive documentation in  and .
The  was updated to incorporate all authentication and vault API endpoints, while  was created to manage MinIO interactions. On the frontend,  and  were updated to provide the user interface for authentication and NAS vault management. The AI engineer then provided all these file contents and manual instructions for creating a GitHub repository, configuring GitHub Container Registry, and deploying the application to the NAS. The final communication revolved around downloading these files and instructions for saving the progress.
